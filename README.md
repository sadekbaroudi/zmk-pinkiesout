This is the firmware for the pinkiesout:

* https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/fingerpunch/tree/master/pinkies-out

Note that this is pre-configured without an OLED, though the keyboard does support an OLED. You will need to adjust the firmware to support.

For an example of firmware that supports an OLED, see:
